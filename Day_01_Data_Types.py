#Task
#Complete the code in the editor below. The variables , , and  are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

#Declare  variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
#Read  lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your  variables.
#Use the  operator to perform the following operations:
#Print the sum of  plus your int variable on a new line.
#Print the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
#Concatenate  with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.


# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
a = 0
b = 0.0
c = ''

# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.
a = int(input())
b = float(input())
c = input()

# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
print(a+i)

# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print(b+d)

# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
print(s+c)
